Modified Thompson Sampling Algorithm

In this project, we wish to investigate the extent to which offline demonstration data can Improve online Learning. In order to do this, we have used traditional Thompsons Sampling in a Multi-armed bandit enviroment. 

Later, we have proposed a Warm Thompson Sampling algorithm which gives higher cumulative reward. Please refer to attached report for detailed mathematical explanation.
